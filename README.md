## 🎯 What This Is

A comprehensive interactive network visualization showing the connections between:
- **Vladimir Putin** and Russian intelligence/oligarch network
- **Xi Jinping** and Chinese Communist Party officials
- **Jeffrey Epstein** and global blackmail operations
- **Donald Trump** and money laundering networks

- Financial networks (JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Bear Stearns)
- Political figures (Netanyahu, Ehud Barak, cabinet officials)
- Tech billionaires (Zuckerberg, Gates, Hoffman)

## 📊 Network Statistics

- **136 nodes**: People, entities, events (1976-2025)
- **227 connections**: Money flows, intelligence ops, relationships
- **Weight-based evidence**: Thicker lines = stronger evidence (1-10 scale)
- **Color-coded types**:
  - 🔴 Red: Central hubs (Epstein, Robert Maxwell, Ghislaine)
  - 🟠 Orange: Intelligence operatives
  - 🟡 Gold: Financial players
  - 🟢 Green: Tech billionaires
  - 🔵 Blue: Political figures
  - 🟣 Purple: Legal team
  - ⚪ Gray: Entities/organizations
  - 🌸 Pink: Victims

## 🔥 Latest Additions (V4)

### Musk-Putin Connections (Feb 14, 2026)
- **Elon Musk** upgraded to size 28 (major player)
- **Musk → Putin**: "Russian party within Trumpist movement"
- **Starlink → Putin**: Russian breach of US data "direct to Russia via Starlink"
- **DOGE → Putin**: Russian IPs accessing US government data (whistleblower testimony)
- **Musk → Trump**: DOGE 2025 enabling Russian access

### Putin's Oligarch Network
- **Oleg Deripaska** (aluminum empire, $19M Manafort debt)
- **Viktor Vekselberg** (energy empire, Deutsche Bank laundering)
- **Paul Manafort** (Trump campaign chairman 2016, Ukraine Russia)
- Direct Putin → oligarchs → Manafort → Trump chain

### Trump-Thiel Direct Connection
- Thiel funded JD Vance $15M for VP pick
- RNC 2016 speech major donor
- Strengthened Kushner connection ($2B Saudi)

## 📚 Data Sources

### Primary Sources
- **The Greatest Heist** manuscript (26 chapters, 1976-2025)
- **Epstein Archive** (83,278 documents via MCP server)
  - House Oversight documents: 25,816
  - Court filings: 835
  - Depositions: 664
  - Flight logs: 218
  - FBI documents: 282
  - Emails: 117

### Key Document Evidence
- JPMorgan internal emails (Jes Staley-Epstein China strategy)
- Katie Johnson lawsuit (April 28, 2016 network mobilization)
- Deutsche Bank records (Trump-Russia money laundering)
- Bear Stearns files (Liquid Funding $4B+ bailout)
- Cambridge Analytica (87M users breach)
- Whistleblower testimony (Russian DOGE breach via Starlink)

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start
1. Download `EPSTEIN_SUPERGRAPH_V4.html`
2. Open in any modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
3. **Drag nodes** to explore connections
4. **Hover over nodes** for details
5. **Scroll to zoom** in/out
6. **Drag background** to pan

### Tips
- Larger nodes = more important figures
- Thicker connections = stronger evidence (weight 8-10)
- Color indicates type (political, financial, intelligence, tech)
- 360-degree physics layout - no hierarchy, free exploration

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Built With
- **D3.js v7** - Force-directed graph visualization
- **Pure JavaScript** - No build process, just open HTML
- **Physics simulation**:
  - Link distance: `(sourceSize + targetSize) × 10` (lots of slack)
  - Link strength: `0.08` (very weak, floppy strings)
  - Repulsion: `-size × 70` (larger nodes push harder)
  - Collision: `size × 3` (wide berth, no overlap)

### Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (tested)
- ✅ Safari (tested)
- ✅ Firefox (should work)
- ❌ IE11 (not supported, don't care)

## 📖 Development Guide

See **[HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md)** for:
- How to add nodes and connections
- Data validation workflow with epstein-archive skill
- Priority development areas:
  - Les Wexner expansion (Victoria's Secret, Mega Group)
  - Cabinet officials (Mnuchin, Ross, Pompeo, DeVos)
  - VP and family (JD Vance, Ivanka, Eric, Don Jr)

## 🔬 Evidence Weight Scale

Connections are weighted 1-10 based on evidence strength:

- **10**: Smoking gun (documented financial, legal evidence, whistleblower)
  - Example: "$19M Manafort debt to Deripaska"
  - Example: "Russian data breach via Starlink direct to Russia"

- **8-9**: Strong evidence (emails, flight logs, photos, credible reporting)
  - Example: "Epstein-Staley 93 emails"
  - Example: "Putin-oligarch networks"

- **6-7**: Documented relationship (public record, confirmed meetings)
  - Example: "PayPal co-founders"

- **4-5**: Probable connection (logical inference, circumstantial)

- **1-3**: Weak/alleged (rumors, unverified)
